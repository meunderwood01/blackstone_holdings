# Blackstone Holdings Data source
The data in this depository is a subset of a dataset created by following the process from Koijen and Yogo (2019). Data is constructed through merging 13F data from Thomsone Reuters through WRDS. Data used includes data from Managers and Stock holdigns. Data prior to June 30, 2013 is used from the SAS old data files present on WRDS and more recent data is based on current data accessible through the main WRDS data set. Data is also merged in from CRSP to have data on stock specific attributes. 

The data in this data set is only a subset of the overall data, restricting to those held by Blackrock (mgrno==9385). The original data was pulled from WRDS on February 5, 2024.
