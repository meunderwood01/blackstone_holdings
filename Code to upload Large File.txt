##First be in the folder that has the data and open the command window
##Then clone your GIT hub repository: 
git clone https://github.com/meunderwood01/blackstone_holdings

##Initialize Large File Storage (LFS) -- note you do have to download this ahead of time: https://git-lfs.com/

git lfs install

##track the correct file type--example is pkl

git lfs track "*.pkl"
##If you've done this correct you should now see a git attributes file in the folder

##push to the remote repository 
git lfs push --all origin main

##Adds the changes in the current directory to staging area
git add. 

##creates a commit with a commment on what changes have been made
gitt commit -m "insert comment"

##pushes to the remote repository 
git push -u origin main

##If you do all these steps correctly then you should see the data folder loaded in your online repository
